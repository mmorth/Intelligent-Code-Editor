# Intelligent-Code-Editor
Intelligent Code Editor is the senior design project that I worked with my team on that translates a natural lanaguge statement describing code into the equivalent Java code. I created the neural machine translation system (translates English to Java code) and had the role of Meeting Facilator (project planning, task delegation, roadblock remover). The user will enter a natural language statement describing the code they want to write. Our system will then convert that statement to equivalent Java code.

Please visit our senior design's team webiste for more information and for access to the code https://sdmay20-46.sd.ece.iastate.edu.
